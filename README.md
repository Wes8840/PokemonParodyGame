# PokemonParodyGame
This is an arcade game that is based off of Pokemon.
<br>
I do not own the rights to pokemon.

# Inspiration
Essentially, I just wanted to create a game of pokemon.

# Problems
I was attempting to use Twilio in an attempt to call the player that they lost/won the game, but it didn't work. So I stopped.

# Next for the game
I may attempt to add more encounters
